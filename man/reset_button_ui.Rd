Shiny ui and server logic for the lock computation.

Note that when including these functions in a learnr Rmd document it is necessary that
the server function, \code{reset_server()}, be included in an R chunk where \code{context="server"} as
they interact with the underlying Shiny functionality. Conversely, the ui function,
\code{reset_button_ui()}, must \emph{not} be included in an R chunk with a \code{context}.
